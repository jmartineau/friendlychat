## Work Distribution
For this chat application, we felt that grasping Firebase is pivotal for the creation of our overall team project. We believed it would be best if each individual took the Udacity course so we could all gain a shared understanding of the application backend. Because of this, there wasn't any distribution of handling different interfaces among the team, although there was collaboration when pieces of the course proved tricky.

## Known Problems
While the application works as it should, issues we ran into mostly included Android Studio. The tutorial followed is a year old, and there are some differences in setting up the project now compared to then. For example, some dependencies have different names or were merged, and it required troubleshooting to iron out those issues. Additionally, some features such as image sharing were not implemented, and the button to do that doesn't work.

## Improvements
As mentioned above, some features were not implemented. These features include image sharing through chat, emoji support, and sending users push notifications. Those are all very important features for a chat application, and should be added in future iterations.
